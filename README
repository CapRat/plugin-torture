---- plugin-torture

This is a tool to test LADSPA and LV2 plugins.

It loads a given plugin and subjects it to some test runs.
Each one is a 1024 sample buffer containing something, then
256 1024-sample buffers of silence to let the plugin recover
(and/or generate denormals!)

These are:

-- silence: all 0 samples.
-- impulse: initial sample of 1, followed by 0s.
-- pulse: 512 1 samples, followed by 512 0 samples.
-- ardour-dc-bias: buffer full of the value that Ardour uses
   if its "DC bias" denormal protection is turned on.
-- flt-min: buffer full of FLT_MIN
-- denormals: buffer full of 1e-38f

The flt-min and denormals tests are only run if --evil is passed
as a parameter, since they cause lots of plugins to generate
denormals (not entirely surprisingly).

---- Denormals

One notable feature of plugin-torture is that it can ask the processor
to raise an exception when a denormal is detected, and hence allow
debugging of such issues.  For this to work, the plugin must be compiled
with SSE support (pass -msse and -mfpmath=sse to GCC).


---- Command-line options

-e|--evil: run particularly evil tests in addition to nicer ones.

-d|--denormals: set the CPU to raise SIGFPE on encountering a denormal.  This will
                be caught and reported.

-a|--abort: abort on SIGFPE; useful if you are gdb-ing a plugin and you want
            to see where a denormal is being introduced.

-s|--ladspa: the plugin is a LADSPA

-l|--lv2: the plugin is a LV2

-p|--plugin <plugin>: specify the plugin.  This should be a .so file for LADSPA
            	      or a .ttl file for LV2.  For LV2s the plugin must be on
                      the LV2 search path.

---- Bugs

Yes.  The Makefile has no dependency information, so be careful if you
modify a header and rebuild (doing a make clean is probably a good idea).
