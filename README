---- plugin-torture

This is a tool to test LADSPA and LV2 plugins.

It loads a given plugin and subjects it to some test runs.
These are:

-- impulse: a 1024-sample buffer with its initial sample as 1 and the
   rest at 0, followed by 256 1024-sample buffers of 0.

OK, so hardly torture at the moment.

---- Denormals

One notable feature of plugin-torture is that it can ask the processor
to raise an exception when a denormal is detected, and hence allow
debugging of such issues.  For this to work, the plugin must be compiled
with SSE support (pass -msse and -mfpmath=sse to GCC).


---- Command-line options

-d: set the CPU to raise SIGFPE on encountering a denormal.  This will
    be caught and reported.

-a: abort on SIGFPE; useful if you are gdb-ing a plugin and you want
    to see where a denormal is being introduced.

-s|--ladspa: the plugin is a LADSPA

-l|--lv2: the plugin is a LV2

-p <plugin>: specify the plugin.  This should be a .so file for LADSPA
             or a .ttl file for LV2.  For LV2s the plugin must be on
             the LV2 search path.

---- Bugs

Yes.  The Makefile has no dependency information, so be careful if you
modify a header and rebuild (doing a make clean is probably a good idea).
